# TriviaGame
I have created a trivia game utilizing HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery in order to manipulate the HTML. 

The theme for this trivia game is based on the TV show, The Office! To start playing, click the Start button. Upon clicking, you will be guided to the next page which will have a timer set for 30 seconds and a question which you have to answer within the time alloted. If you do not answer within the 30 seconds or you answer incorrectly, the timer will stop and the correct answer will be revealed. If you happen to pick the right answer, the timer will also stop and you will get a notification that you guessed right! 

Good Luck!
